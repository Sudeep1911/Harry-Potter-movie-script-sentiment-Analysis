Explore Harry Potter movie dialogues with NLP! Analyze sentiments of characters, visualize data, and predict sentiment of new sentences using machine learning. Dive into the magical world of text analysis


Our project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and visualize dialogues from the Harry Potter movie series. 


We preprocess the text data, perform sentiment analysis on character dialogues, and generate insights into the sentiments expressed by different characters across the movies. 


Additionally, we use machine learning models to classify the sentiment of new sentences and provide a tool for sentiment prediction. 


Our project offers a comprehensive exploration of NLP and sentiment analysis within the context of popular movie dialogues.
